1. Game Design
We opted to make a game design similar to the 'SETvival' suggestion, with some changes. 
Our design concepts included:
	- A sandbox style resource gathering game with a lot of potential for a player to expand and exploit, but no explicit goals
	- A top-down view of a large, tiled world
	- A wide variety of resources, some that can be collected from natural sources, and some that are only available through refinement
	- Resources that are depleted by workers and buildings as they use them to produce more resources
	- Several craftable buildings that consume/produce different resources
	- A procedurally generated world with natural resources depending on the biome in the area


2. Game Manual

Controls
	The camera can be panned with the arrow keys/WASD. The Space Bar can zoom out, the LShift key can zoom in.
	Clicking on a hexagon will highlight it, and show details for that tile in the left side menu. These details can include the natural resources present, or the building present, how many workers are needed to work/currently working on the tile, and the build button which opens the build menu. The build menu has all the buildings that can be built at the bottom. Their icon is darkened if you cannot afford them right now. After hovering on a building icon, its description will appear in the middle. When you have decided, you can hit 'build' in the upper right corner to build.

Resources
	There are 2 types of resources: raw materials, and 'supply' resources. Raw materials are listed in the bar at the bottom of the screen. They are gathered from tiles manually, as well as producedby buildings. They are used to build additional buildings. Supply Resources are listed at the top, they include people, food, water, and power. These resources come only from buildings, and are used to fuel buildings. People work tiles, and consume food and water. Many buildings consume water and power to produce resources.

Buildings
	Buildings are important features that can be added to empty tiles. They automatically provide additional resources. They have an initial cost, which can be seen in the build menu, that must be paid to begin construction. After a short time, the building will be done. Some buildings, such as the tent, Do not need workers and will be providing their full benefit as soon as they are built. Others, such as a mine, require workers to produce their resources. Clicking on the building will tell you how many workers are need, and allow you to assign workers to that building. A progress bar will fill up to show how fast the building is producing. When the building produces, its workers will consume food and water (1 each). Some buildings have additional upkeep when they produce, such as the power plant, which requires water to produce power.
